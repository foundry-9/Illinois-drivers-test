3. Verify: `questionHistory[questionId].consecutiveCorrect === 1`
4. Do NOT encounter same question
5. Manually set `questionHistory[questionId].consecutiveCorrect = 1`
6. Answer it correctly
7. Verify: `questionHistory[questionId].consecutiveCorrect === 2`

3. Verify: `questionHistory[questionId].consecutiveCorrect === 0`
4. Verify: `questionHistory[questionId].mastered === false`

**Scenario C: Multiple mastery attempts**
1. Answer question correctly 2x in a row (mastered)
2. Answer it incorrectly (should stay mastered but reset consecutive)
3. Answer it correctly again (consecutive starts fresh at 1)
4. Verify `mastered` status persists even with new attempts

### 2.2 First Attempt Correct Tracking

**Test Case: `firstAttemptCorrect` flag set correctly**

ls -lh css/*.css
ls -lh data/qna.json
```

**Targets:**

3. Compress qna.json
4. Remove unused animations

### 6.2 Page Load Performance

**Measure with Chrome DevTools:**

**Steps:**
1. Open DevTools > Lighthouse
2. Run Performance audit (throttle to "Slow 4G")

   - [ ] Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5s
   - [ ] Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1
   - [ ] Total Blocking Time (TBT): < 300ms

**If scores below target:**
- Analyze what's blocking
- Minify and compress assets
- Defer non-critical CSS
- Optimize images

### 6.3 Memory Leak Testing

**Test with Chrome DevTools:**

**Steps:**
1. Open DevTools > Memory tab
2. Take Heap Snapshot (baseline)
3. Complete several practice tests
4. Take another Heap Snapshot
5. Compare: Memory should not grow significantly

**Expected:** No memory growth after multiple test sessions

**Steps:**
1. In DevTools Console: `localStorage.questionHistory = 'corrupted data'`
2. Refresh page
3. Expected: App handles gracefully (reset or warning)

### 7.3 Private/Incognito Mode

**Test Case: Local Storage disabled**

**Steps:**
1. Open app in private/incognito mode
2. Try to save data
3. Expected: Graceful handling (warning that data won't persist)
