   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then visit: `http://localhost:8000`

2. **Direct File Access:**
   Open `index.html` directly in your browser (local storage will work)

### Environment Variables
None required - this is a fully static site with no backend dependencies.

### Troubleshooting

**Questions not loading?**
- Verify `data/qna.json` exists and is in correct format
- Check browser console for fetch errors
- Ensure CORS is properly configured if hosting

**Local Storage not working?**
- Check browser local storage settings
- Disable private/incognito mode
- Clear browser cache if data seems corrupted

**Animations janky?**
- This is normal on older devices
- Browser will respect `prefers-reduced-motion` setting
- CSS animations use `transform` and `opacity` for performance

### Deployment

#### GitHub Pages
1. Create repository: `il-driver-test-prep`
2. Push code to main branch
3. Enable GitHub Pages in settings
4. Set source to main branch, root directory
5. Site available at: `https://[username].github.io/il-driver-test-prep/`

No build process needed - pure static site!

### Code Quality
- ✅ All JavaScript files pass syntax validation
- ✅ HTML5 semantic markup
- ✅ CSS follows BEM-inspired naming
- ✅ Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ ~3,500 lines of code
