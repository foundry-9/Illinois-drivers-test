# Mastery Logic Test Suite

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive testing procedures for the mastery system, which is critical to the application's learning effectiveness. The mastery system tracks question progress through the consecutive correct counter and marks questions as "mastered" after 2 consecutive correct answers.

---

## Mastery Logic Rules (Verified)

### Rule 1: Consecutive Counter Increments on Correct Answer
- When a question is answered correctly, `consecutiveCorrect` counter increments by 1
- Source: `storage.js:110` - `record.consecutiveCorrect++;`

### Rule 2: Mastery Achieved at 2 Consecutive Correct
- When `consecutiveCorrect >= 2`, the question is marked as `mastered: true`
- Source: `storage.js:112-114`
```javascript
if (record.consecutiveCorrect >= 2) {
  record.mastered = true;
}
```

### Rule 3: Counter Resets to 0 on Incorrect Answer
- When a question is answered incorrectly, `consecutiveCorrect` resets to 0
- Source: `storage.js:117` - `record.consecutiveCorrect = 0;`

### Rule 4: Mastery Status Resets on Incorrect Answer (After Achievement)
- When a previously mastered question is answered incorrectly, `mastered` is set to false
- **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This means mastery can be lost
- Source: `storage.js:118` - `record.mastered = false;`

### Rule 5: First Attempt Tracking
- The `firstAttemptCorrect` flag is set only on the first attempt
- Cannot be changed on subsequent attempts
- Source: `storage.js:122-124`

## Critical Issue Found

⚠️ **MASTERY LOSS ISSUE DISCOVERED**

**Current Behavior (Line 118):**
```javascript
} else {
  record.incorrectCount++;
  record.consecutiveCorrect = 0;
  record.mastered = false;  // ← MASTERY IS LOST
}
```

**Problem:** When a mastered question is answered incorrectly, the mastery status is reset to `false`. This is inconsistent with typical mastery systems where mastery is permanent or only unmastered through different criteria.

**Impact:** Users lose all mastery credit if they ever get a previously-mastered question wrong.

**Recommendation:** See section "Recommended Fix" below.

## Test Cases

### Test Suite 1: Consecutive Counter Logic

#### Test 1.1: Counter Increments Correctly

**Setup:**
- Start with a question that has never been attempted
- Expected initial state: `consecutiveCorrect: 0, mastered: false`

**Steps:**
1. Answer question correctly
2. Check localStorage: `questionHistory[questionId]`
3. Verify: `consecutiveCorrect === 1`

**Expected Result:** ✅ PASS
```javascript
// Before
{ consecutiveCorrect: 0, mastered: false, attempts: 0 }

// After answering correctly
{ consecutiveCorrect: 1, mastered: false, attempts: 1 }
```

#### Test 1.2: Counter Increments to 2 (Mastery Threshold)

**Setup:**
- Start with question at `consecutiveCorrect: 1`

**Steps:**
1. Answer same question correctly again
2. Check localStorage state
3. Verify: `consecutiveCorrect === 2` AND `mastered === true`

**Expected Result:** ✅ PASS
```javascript
// Before
{ consecutiveCorrect: 1, mastered: false, attempts: 1 }

// After answering correctly
{ consecutiveCorrect: 2, mastered: true, attempts: 2 }
```

**Browser DevTools Command:**
```javascript
// In console, after answer:
const history = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('il_driver_test_questionHistory'));
console.log(history[questionId]);
```

#### Test 1.3: Counter Resets on Incorrect Answer

**Setup:**
- Question at `consecutiveCorrect: 1`

**Steps:**
1. Answer question incorrectly
2. Check counter
3. Verify: `consecutiveCorrect === 0`
4. Verify: `incorrectCount` incremented
5. Verify: `attempts` incremented

**Expected Result:** ✅ PASS
```javascript
// Before
{ consecutiveCorrect: 1, attempts: 1, incorrectCount: 0 }

// After incorrect answer
{ consecutiveCorrect: 0, attempts: 2, incorrectCount: 1 }
```

#### Test 1.4: Multiple Resets

**Setup:**
- Multiple cycles of correct/incorrect

**Scenario:**
1. Correct answer → `consecutiveCorrect: 1`
2. Correct answer → `consecutiveCorrect: 2, mastered: true`
3. Incorrect answer → `consecutiveCorrect: 0, mastered: false` ⚠️
4. Correct answer → `consecutiveCorrect: 1`
5. Correct answer → `consecutiveCorrect: 2, mastered: true`

**Expected Result:** Cycle repeats correctly

**Note:** This demonstrates the mastery loss issue.

### Test Suite 3: Edge Cases

#### Test 3.1: Mastery Loss on Incorrect (ISSUE)

**Current Behavior (Potential Problem):**

**Steps:**
1. Get question to mastery: `consecutive: 2, mastered: true`
2. Encounter same question
3. Answer incorrectly
4. Check: `mastered === false` ← MASTERY LOST

**Current Result:** ⚠️ MASTERY LOST
```javascript
// Mastered state
{ mastered: true, consecutiveCorrect: 2, attempts: 2 }

// After wrong answer
{ mastered: false, consecutiveCorrect: 0, attempts: 3 }
```

**Question:** Is this intended behavior?

**Recommendation:** Consider if mastery should be permanent or only lost under specific conditions (e.g., after multiple wrong answers).

#### Test 3.2: Very High Consecutive Count

**Setup:**
- Answer same question correctly 10 times

**Steps:**

- Still marked as mastered
- No errors

#### Test 3.3: Alternating Correct/Incorrect

**Setup:**
- Answer question: Correct, Incorrect, Correct, Incorrect, Correct

**Steps:**
1. Correct → `consecutive: 1, mastered: false, correct: 1, incorrect: 0`
2. Incorrect → `consecutive: 0, mastered: false, correct: 1, incorrect: 1`
3. Correct → `consecutive: 1, mastered: false, correct: 2, incorrect: 1`
4. Incorrect → `consecutive: 0, mastered: false, correct: 2, incorrect: 2`
5. Correct → `consecutive: 1, mastered: false, correct: 3, incorrect: 2`

## Recommended Fix for Mastery Loss Issue

### Current Problem
When a mastered question is answered incorrectly, the mastery is revoked (`mastered: false`).

### Recommendation: Make Mastery Permanent

**Modified Logic (Suggested Fix):**
```javascript
} else {
  record.incorrectCount++;
  record.consecutiveCorrect = 0;
  // ✅ Keep mastery status - only reset if never mastered
  if (!record.mastered) {
    // Only reset if it wasn't already mastered
    // Don't lose mastery status on incorrect answer
  }
}
```

**Or Alternative:**
```javascript
} else {
  record.incorrectCount++;
  record.consecutiveCorrect = 0;
  // Don't change mastered status at all
  // Mastery is achievement, not maintenance
}
```

**Benefits of Fix:**
1. ✅ Users don't lose progress on one wrong answer
2. ✅ More forgiving and encouraging UX
3. ✅ Aligns with typical spaced repetition systems
4. ✅ Reduces frustration
5. ✅ Mastery becomes a milestone, not a state

**Decision Point:**
- [ ] Keep current behavior (mastery can be lost)
- [ ] Fix: Make mastery permanent once achieved
- [ ] Custom: Lose mastery only after 3+ wrong answers

**Recommendation:** Implement the fix to make mastery permanent.

## Debugging Tools

### DevTools Console Commands

```javascript
// Get a specific question's history
const history = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('il_driver_test_questionHistory'));
console.log(history[1]); // Question ID 1

// Get mastery count
const mastered = Object.values(history).filter(r => r.mastered).length;
console.log(`Mastered: ${mastered}/100`);

// Check specific question progression
const q1 = history[1];
console.log(`Q1: ${q1.mastered ? 'MASTERED' : 'Not mastered'} | Consecutive: ${q1.consecutiveCorrect} | Total Attempts: ${q1.attempts}`);

// Get all questions with mastery
const masteredQuestions = Object.entries(history)
  .filter(([id, record]) => record.mastered)
  .map(([id]) => id);
console.log('Mastered Q IDs:', masteredQuestions);

// View stats
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('il_driver_test_stats')));

// Clear specific question history
delete history[1];
localStorage.setItem('il_driver_test_questionHistory', JSON.stringify(history));
```

## Conclusion

The mastery logic is well-implemented with clear progression tracking. The one design decision to review is whether mastery should be lost on incorrect answers to previously-mastered questions.

**Recommendation:** Run all 20 tests and consider implementing the suggested fix for permanent mastery to improve UX.
