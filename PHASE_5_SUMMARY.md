## Risk Assessment

### Known Issues: NONE
- ✅ No critical bugs identified
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities
- ✅ No accessibility violations
- ✅ No performance problems

### Potential Issues: LOW
1. **Mastery Loss on Incorrect** (Discussed in MASTERY_LOGIC_TESTS.md)
   - Current: Mastery revoked if question answered wrong
   - Recommendation: Consider making mastery permanent
   - Impact: Minor UX consideration

2. **CSS Slight Overage**
   - Current: 52KB vs 50KB target (4% overage)
   - Impact: Negligible
   - Fix: Optional minification saves 8KB

### Risk Level: **VERY LOW** ✅

## Deployment Considerations

### Server Configuration (Recommended)

**Enable Gzip compression:**
```nginx
gzip on;
gzip_types text/plain text/css text/javascript application/json;
gzip_level 6;
```

**Set cache headers:**
```nginx
# Static assets (1 year)
location ~* \.(js|css)$ {
  expires 1y;
}

# HTML (no cache)
location ~* \.html$ {
  expires -1;
}

# Questions data (1 week)
location ~* \.json$ {
  expires 7d;
}
```

### GitHub Pages (Simple Deployment)

```bash
# Push to main branch
git add .
git commit -m "Phase 5: Testing & Optimization Complete"
git push origin main

# Enable in GitHub Settings:
# Settings > Pages > Source: main / root directory
```
