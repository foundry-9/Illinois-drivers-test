### Functional Requirements

1. User greeting and name capture on first visit
2. Practice test mode with immediate feedback
3. Score tracking and analytics
4. "Missed questions" remediation system
5. Mastery-based question retirement (correct 2-3 times in a row)
6. Review mode for previously missed questions
7. Progress persistence across sessions

## User Experience Design

2. Friendly message: "Welcome to the Illinois Driver's Test Prep!"
3. Input field: "What's your first name?"
4. Submit → Save to Local Storage → Navigate to Dashboard

### 2. Question Selection Logic

**Practice Mode**:

- Select 35 questions (matching actual test length)
- Prioritize questions with fewer attempts
- Include mix of categories

- Randomize order

**Review Mode**:

- Show only questions with incorrectCount > 0 AND mastered = false

### 3. Mastery System

**Criteria for Mastery**:

- Question must be answered correctly 2-3 times consecutively
- Counter resets to 0 on any incorrect answer
- Once mastered, question can be excluded from future tests (user setting)
- Visual celebration when question is mastered

**Example Logic**:

```js
// After answering a question correctly
if (questionHistory[id].consecutiveCorrect >= 2) {
  questionHistory[id].mastered = true;
  showMasteryAnimation();
}

// After answering incorrectly
questionHistory[id].consecutiveCorrect = 0;
questionHistory[id].mastered = false;
```

### 4. Progress Tracking

## Questions for Consideration

1. **Question Selection**: Should we show all 100 questions in rotation, or generate 35-question tests that mimic the real test format?
   - Recommendation: Generate 35-question tests to match real exam experience

2. **Mastery Threshold**: How many consecutive correct answers to mark as mastered?
   - Recommendation: 2 consecutive (balances confidence and efficiency)

3. **Mastered Questions**: Should mastered questions be excluded from future tests?
   - Recommendation: User preference toggle, default to "included but less frequent"

4. **Category Study**: Should users be able to study specific categories?
   - Recommendation: Yes, add as optional mode in Phase 4

5. **Timer**: Should there be a timed mode?
   - Recommendation: Optional feature for Phase 5, default is untimed

6. **Graphics Style**: Illustrations, photos, or iconography?
   - Recommendation: Flat illustration style with icons for efficiency

## Getting Started

Once approved, development will begin with Phase 1 (MVP) focusing on core functionality. The modular structure allows for iterative development, with each phase building on the previous one.

**Estimated Timeline**:

- Phase 1 (MVP): 2-3 days
- Phase 2 (Remediation): 1-2 days
- Phase 3 (Polish): 2-3 days
- Phase 4 (Features): 1-2 days
- Phase 5 (Testing): 1-2 days

**Total**: 1-2 weeks for full implementation
